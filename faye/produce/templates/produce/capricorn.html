			<p>
				One winter night I tried to watch you sleep<br>
				But folds of darkness knotted in my eyes,<br>
				Like bitter coffee dried onto a cup,<br>
				Or clotted thoughts gone cold inside my mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				I couldnâ€™t see your tiny twisted form<br>
				Or feel your breath upon my ghostly hand.<br>
				Instead I saw the slatted blinds were worn<br>
				And dust had coated thick our summer fan.
			</p>
			<p>
				How strange it was that everything but you<br>
				In sleep acquired features so bizarre.<br>
				The bed a palm, red lips across the moon,<br>
				A furrowed face of tangled clouds and stars.
			</p>
			<p>
				How natural, though, that in such perfect dark<br>
				You were the world, the liquid in my heart.
