					“Very well. It is a story about a woman. A mother who came to the shrine one evening. Sometime long ago. I heard her heeled shoes clicking against the road before she came in, and the sound of her wool jacket rasping against itself. The air was dry as bone. She came to the shrine, dropped her coin in, and then came to sit by the lamp where you found me, certainly taking no care to keep her clothes from getting dirty from the dark soil that sits hidden between the bricks. With my eyes I could see her high eyebrows and small chin, her gloved hands and red hair barrette. I could see even if I could not, you see? I could see the tops of her cheeks turn pink in the cold. She began to speak, to no one, about her child, and over time it became clear to me that the child had died. She did not cry, or ask for the world to be changed, or even simply scream at the sky. She told stories of watching the child eat food, wake up after naps, come home from school with the secret smile of having learned something they were sure nobody else could know as well as them. In some sense she left the child with me, you see. And before she left the shrine she spent a few minutes straightening her coat, brushing off her clothing’s fabric and refastening her hair. I watched as she put herself together, and then, all in one piece, she left. And I am to this day confused about where the child is now. Who holds them?”
