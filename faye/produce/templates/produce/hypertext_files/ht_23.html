					The surface of the rough <a href="https://spendsmartcard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Meaning-Of-Japanese-Stone-Lanterns.jpg" target="_blank">stone lantern</a> jitters under the unstable flame. Cavities and protuberances boil in and out of existence. It hasn’t occurred to me before how alive fire is.

					I try to imagine that the flame is a candle from my birthday, all those years ago. As if I could somehow pull one through time, along with the streamers, the cake, guests I don’t remember, and whatever silent secrets are communicated between the adults at children’s parties, over the heads of their happy, screaming kids. I want the flame to be the same, but no matter what it’s different. The lighter starts to burn my thumb.

					I let the flame die. Darkness rushes back. I ask if anyone is out there, surprised at how I sound: that I make a sound at all. No response comes. I light the lighter again.

					The sound is coming from behind the base of the stone lantern. I crouch, holding the lighter in front of me like a weapon. Behind the lantern is a small adjoining stone structure, about the size of a microwave oven, with an open front and a small stone roof. It is like its own miniature shrine: the ones you find on roadsides or in forests, by small towns or near the ocean. Small alcoves of the unfrequented.
