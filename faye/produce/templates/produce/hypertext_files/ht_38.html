					“There is a story that they sometimes tell children,” the kabocha says, “in a part of the country, up north, where it was so cold that the language itself changed to shorter sounds—to better protect the breath. They tell the story because, when tapes like yours made it up there, where such things had not often been thought of or desired, the people were amazed at hearing such long stretches of speech. Whole songs sung into rarefied air, seemingly against all reason.”

					“Some of the children, though, who took these devices from their parents, became obsessed with them. Listened to them all day, recorded themselves in warm places and played it back in the cold. Some of these children began to report a strange feeling—they said that they’d found a friend in the recorder, and that it would say what they had wanted to say. That as they recorded themselves, so too were they being recorded, if that makes sense, child. And at first this was fun.”

					“To other parents, though, who understood the games and habits of children, this was no matter. They were not spooked by the voices of themselves in boxes. They had been to the cities. And so they let these games between children carry on, as all children should be encouraged to imagine. And then their children would grow up, and they would leave these fears behind. So they thought.”
