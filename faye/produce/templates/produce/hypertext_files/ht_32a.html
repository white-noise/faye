					I hear a man’s voice saying “Is it on? We’ve only got one chance at this, you know. Think of what it’s going to be like, to have all of this? Are you getting it?” Then your voice comes on the tape: “Don’t worry honey, whatever it is that happens, we’re going to get it, okay? Now shh: quiet.” I hear more giggling, my own giggling, and then the sound of my lips smacking. A minute passes and my dad tries to speak again, “Think of how great it’s going to be to live this moment again, later. Just imagine having a tiny tape of all this stuff that our kid says! Honey, lean in, make sure you’re getting it. Come on now.” I hear even more precisely the sound of my own breathing and laughing. But I don’t say a word. The tape continues on like this for a long time. I hear my dad sigh in the background. I hear my mom kiss my forehead and whisper into the recorder that it was going to be all right, even if today was not the day. The tape cuts to silence again.
