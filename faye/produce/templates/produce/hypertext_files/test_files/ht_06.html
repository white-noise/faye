					It’s not hard to do. You log into a chat room and say things that you like. Share things about yourself. Everyone on the internet is interested in so many things. They have to put it all down into words. Once I talked with someone who told me that they lived in the south, and that even in the fall they have mangoes and pineapples growing where they are. It is fall now, and I cannot imagine those fruit growing here. He asked what we had and I said persimmons. He didn’t seem excited about that. I suddenly know where I am walking toward. It is because of a big mural on the side of a laundromat. It's a pretty mural, for a laundromat.
