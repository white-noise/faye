					“Sometimes I think I can remember my original patch—where I was grown, crazy as that seems,” the kabocha says, “somewhere with a good amount of sun, cool air, and dark soil. I remember people coming through, but not a lot. It was not a tourist spot, but it was not a farm in isolation. I think. From time to time, I think, people would come and appraise me. Complement my color, or those kabocha around me. But I start to forget things—the types of birds nearby, the feeling of water flowing into me. I’ve forgotten, I think, what it feels like to have my outsides separate from my insides, which is, in a way, how I think we experience loneliness. Trying to reconcile us versus that which is not us. The only way I see is through these flames, you see? And they are not natural, but I don’t remember, I think, what came before them. Or I choose not to remember. It is unclear, what I tell myself I remember, and what I do. It is all so unclear.”
