					The kabocha speaks, “We all hear things we are not meant to. See things we are not meant to. Things we were never even able to see or hear before, such that, in a series of great accidents over the course of our lives, or perhaps by great invention and change (I see few differences), we become accustomed to being misled, coming to find ourselves wanting it. It is a gnawing, you know. It is how you grew up, too. How you learned about kissing. How you learned about death. And now, more than ever, we are subject to secrets from the past, caught on things like your magnetic tape, or in the cramped backsides of cameras. Coiled tightly in dark movie halls. I do not mean to listen to things I am not meant to hear—no I do not—or see things I am not meant to see. But I do, and they make me sad in the way knowing any secret makes one sad. Everyone likes trying to know secrets, not actually knowing them, it seems.”
