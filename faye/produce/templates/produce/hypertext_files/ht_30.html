					“Just through the passage over there,” says the kabocha. I eye the gap as before, which is bathed in shadow. I have stiffened into my crouch while listening to the kabocha speak, and so when I reach in to take it, cupping my hands around its pebbly sides, I find my knees and shoulders complaining. I am careful not to jostle it. I place it under my arm, draping the coat to protect it; I was not about to be responsible for a draft blowing out the kabocha’s eyes.

This circumstance, however, seemed to call for the inappropriate. If you reject the strange, you told me, only more strangeness comes. I have to tent my coat over the kabocha and push away branches hanging over the passage, easing over roots and bits of brick that had come undone from the small path it had pointed out to me.
