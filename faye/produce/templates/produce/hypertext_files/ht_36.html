					After another stretch of silent tape, and then you start saying things again. We must be outside, because there is the sound of wind and trees rustling and birds I can’t name but which you always could. You must be yelling to me, far off. Saying that I am doing such a good job. Maybe I am riding a bike, or pumping my legs on a swingset, or using a drinking fountain by myself for the first time. You are telling me that I am doing a good job and that you are so proud of me. I can’t see the park that we are in but it sounds beautiful, with a specificity I thought it not possible for sound alone to provide.

As a sign of future success and the child’s innate, truly empathic goodness.
