					In it, I hear the sound of hissing, metal bumping gently into metal. You telling me to be careful tells me that we are cooking together. I am told to stay away from knives, and to watch you do the cutting. I imagine a huge pile of vegetables and the sounds of cutting, each of them different—long stringy chops, short high squeaks, thunderous snaps, suggest a million kinds of food. I keep asking when you are going to be done, and you tell me to go and play with all the pulp that came out of the pumpkin we are using to <a href="http://www.healthygreenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/kabochasoup.jpg" target="_blank">make our soup</a>.
