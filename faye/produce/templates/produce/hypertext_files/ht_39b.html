					We emerge into a clearing. If there was a city around us, I would not have known it. And when I say it was a clearing, I mean there were no large trees. The ground was not flat but rolling, a small hill pushing toward the black sky. Nested in the folds of the hill were gravestones and other stone detritus, maybe the remains of walls, or even older structures on top of which <a href="https://i1.wp.com/insearchoflostplaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0958.jpg?fit=900%2C600" target="_blank">the most recent ruins sat</a>. Long grass shot up around the stones, as if to soften the transition between the hills and the toothy forms.
