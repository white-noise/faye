# project faye

## next steps
- update css specifically for library and status; fix for mobile
- rewrite individual pages for written and visual objects
- include image support in the visual work section
- enable many to many relationship with library objects and produce app
- eventually allow for better indexing of produce and library (e.g., sorting)
- constructing preview and most-recent displays for produce section
- enabling smart back-paging (i.e., return to proper page of paginator object)
- use of block delimiters for standardized header among html documents (also css sharing)

## notes
- probably page numbers can be easily passed to individual templates
- various default model parameters are not automatically filled in currently
- should back-paging from referenced library objects be enabled?
- admin page aesthetics (e.g., horizontal transfer for many to many relations) should be addressed
