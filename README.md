# project faye

## next steps
- fixing css for mobile, and paring down all css to minimal needed (i.e., genericize)
- specifically some of the :hover behavior is wonky right now
- including home buttons in relevant pages
- enabling smart back-paging (i.e., return to proper page of paginator object)
- enabling reasonable sorting methods for library contents (i.e., alphabetical by last name, by pub date, by acq date)
- it might be edifying to include an integrated email form (I don't prefer the idea of comments or posting).
- finalizing production mode image/media serving (should be easy as only admin has privilege)
- actual aesthetic changes to the website (viz images, lettering)

## notes
- probably page numbers can be easily passed to individual templates for back-paging
- should back-paging from referenced library objects be enabled? (can always use back gestures)
- admin page aesthetics (e.g., horizontal filter for many to many relations)
